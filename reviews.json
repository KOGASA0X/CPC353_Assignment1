Also, to be able view the transaction history on web portal. I believe this app primarily designed for \"e-wallet\", that is the reason many feature related to physical TnG card is not available.",

There's an option to use face verification to pay, but it's still in pandemic and taking off mask just to pay seems like a bad idea -- so where's fingerprint payment option? Other than that, I like quick payment (not auto top up, they work differently in the app) -- effectively takes away needing to top up everytime it runs low. Edit: Just to add, I didn't complain on ads because I turned it off in android's settings the moment I got an ad.",

This make me feel unsafe like showing my bank acc to others and not dare to reload large amt when the amt can be seen in first page. Besides, what is the purpose of showing ur balance to the recipient when making payment？ u won‘t show ur whole money in wallet when u make payment right？ It‘s not safe, hope this will be enhance else it could be an issue if reload large amt.",

At this stage, I would expect it to allow it to be a unified touch and go app. Not an independent wallet to put in money. We are not ready for this for at least a few more years. It felt like the company is trying to get more consumer cash to fund their things. This is totally unethical. Your CTO and CIO really need to learn to look from consumers' perspective.

Pay - using qr code scan which not much merchant accept 2. Transfer - only allow if the account tie to a credit or debit card. It doesn't allow transfer of money without tie up despite there is credit in the wallet. 3. Prepaid and Postpaid - which can be done using normal internet banking rather than ewallet 4. Bill payment - only allows astro for the moment 5. Cinema ticket - only mbo is available. 6. Flight - no comment. Frankly speaking, I'm currently using bigpay and it is so much more convinient to use as compared to this ewallet. It allows login using pin or fingerprint rather than key in phone number n 6 digit PIN in theTNG app. A lot more to be improve and still, my main disappointment is the inability to even cater its own core business (top up touch n go).",

Emailed in, got a reply that they are experiencing \"high traffic\". Haven't gotten a response from a human yet and yes, still not able to use my eWallet. And I wonder why we can't reload our touch&go card using the apps? Wouldn't it make sense if we could reload the card automatically if we are traveling on highway?",

      "replyText": "We regret the inconvenience. However, please note that we're currently experiencing heavy traffic from the influx of eTunai Rakyat submissions. We're working on rectifying the issue. The reason you're unable to reload because your TNG card is a Smartcard with a MIFARE chip, this means transactions can only take place upon contact with a card reader",

Reason : Principal Asset Management Bhd, the party handling GO+ investment, is shortchanging / cheating investors. For daily earnings of less than 1 sen, the earnings are calculated down to 4 decimal points, and accumulated till it reaches 1 sen & credited to the investor. But for earnings above 1 sen but less than 2 sen, Principal conveniently removes the 4 decimal point calculation method, and rounds down, every day, any amount greater than 1 sen but less than 2 sen. So, if you're earning 1.9 sen everyday for 10 days, you'll only be credited 1 sen per day for 10 days, or a total of 10 sen, instead of 1.9 x 10 = 19 sen. So, they can promise u a certain percentage in returns, yet don't really need to give you the full amount promised. And in allowing this to happen, TnG & CIMB are also equally guilty of cheating consumers.",

End up the vendor have to give me back coins for the balance. I am using Android base phone. Not sure if Apple phone have this issue. Overall I think this app make it very easy to pay tolls and let us avoid the hassel of reloading the TnG card once all the highways tolls is included in the direct pay coverage.",

To do that she had to submit the photo of her NRIC, She had done that at least 60 times over almost one month but each time T&G rejected the photo as not clear. I think it was the image of her face. She is obese and the very photo taken at the National Registration Office showed a plain face almost featureless. So no matter how many times she tried, she failed this stage of verification. This is very unfair because it is not her fault. She is now left with just a few days to submit her claim. Kindly advise me an alternate route to circumvent this. Many thanks",

Just stop advertise your app in any youtube branch just because we have toll in malaysia. get your app to fully function and release it again once everything is set up.Stop wasting people time to run for reload on the toll and wasting people money on our eWallet. Just make a fully functional way to pay tolls around malaysia would be great instead of paying bills and etc..",

While the function is there (still under beta), the inability to integrate the TNG card balance with the app's function is such a fatal mistakes. Some cards such as student card has a privilege of 50% price discount for LRT fares, or the RM 100 monthly fees, using this app means we have to forfeit the privilege, cause this app has its own credit to charge the fees. Edit: To staff that replied to this, I appreciate you taking your time reading my review. I understand the difficulty faced for merging TNG with the app, I feel that if it is possible it will be best quality of life changes this app could possible bring, and I don't mind waiting for years until this feature is possible. Other than that, the core features of the app (cashless transaction) is a positive from me, but not widely accessible at the moment, but I'm sure it's matter of time.
